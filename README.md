I originally started Blackbird in mid-2013 and continued development through 
late 2014 when I finally realized what a **ridiculous monstrosity Blackboard
is**, halting development to retain my sanity. Essentially, the module can
be used, but it is *far* from complete. 

This repo contains various support scripts that were never fully implemented
into Blackbird itself, including `manifest_module.py` which was planned 
to be a binary manifest file implementation but was abandoned, and the `bb_tk`
submodule which provides a graphical frontend for certain aspects of Blackbird
(in partial working order).
